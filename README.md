# TrashAndGoServer
Back-end server for the TrashAndGo app, built using Python.
* Stored bin information and locations, and handled GET reqests for this data from the Client.
* Took photo files of a barcode from the Client via POST requests. It then made use of the pyzbar online API, which took the image and returned the images barcode number.

Akhilesh (as14g18) and Sohaib (cleverman88) both handled the back-end development.
